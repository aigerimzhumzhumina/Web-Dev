        <p>Today marks the start of my journey into programming! I’ve just begun learning HTML and CSS, and I’m excited about all the possibilities ahead. Creating this blog is my first step into the world of web development. I can't wait to build more complex projects in the future.</p>

        <h6>Posted on January 24, 2025</h6>
        <p>After learning the basics of HTML and CSS, I decided to create a simple recipe book as my first project. It was a fun challenge to figure out how to structure the content and make it look visually appealing. I also learned about tables and how to use them for organizing information. This is just the beginning!</p>
